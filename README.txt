Detailed description of the purpose of the project:
The aim of the project is to implement a number of solutions to the problem of finding a minimal spreading tree, to explore
And analyze the differences between the different solutions.
MST's will be calculated by two main algorithms:
1. A kruskal algorithm where sorting is implemented by a quick-sort algorithm and Disjoint Sets (Forest).
2. A prim algorithm when the priority queue is implemented by a binary stack.
3. Later, the user will enter one arc which must be removed from the graph, and if the arc
   Belonged to the MST found with kruskal, It will find a new MST without it.
